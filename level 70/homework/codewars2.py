# Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num (both inclusive). The number will always be a positive 
# integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example 
# below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

def summation(num):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        sum += i
    return sum
